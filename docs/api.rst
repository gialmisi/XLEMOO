Description
===========

The XLEMOO framework consists of various files, or modules,
with classes and functions to implement, train, and
study LEMOO models. The contents of each file are roughly the following:

=====================================  ==============================================================================
Module                                 Description
=====================================  ==============================================================================
``xlemoo.lemoo``                       Contains the main logic and functionalities to implement LEMOO models.
``xlemoo.ruleset_interpreter``         Contains functionalities to extract and interpret rule set based machine learning models, mainly from the `imodels`_ package.
``xlemoo.tree_interpreter``            Contains functionalities to extract and interpret tree based machine learning models.
``xlemoo.fitness_indicators``          Contains implementations of various fitness indicators used in LEMOO models.
``xlemoo.selection``                   Contains selection operators utilized in the evolutionary mode of LEMOO models.
``xlemoo.utilities``                   Contains various utilities that can be used across the XLEMOO framework.
``xlemoo.plotting``                    Contains means to plot information related to the populations generated by LEMOO models.

Examples
========

The examples below showcase how the XLEMOO framework can be utilized. For most of its multiobjective
optimization needs, XLEMOO utilizes the `DESDEO framework <https://desdeo.it.jyu.fi>`_. 
Particularly, in the below examples, the test problems from the ``desdeo-problem`` package are used, which are
documented `here <https://desdeo-problem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/problems.html>`_. Scalarization
functions are in turn utilized from the ``desdeo-tools`` package, which are documented
`here <https://desdeo-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/scalarization/index.html>`_.
Some evolutionary operators are utilized from the ``desdeo-emo`` package, which are in turn
documented `here <https://desdeo-emo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/desdeo_emo/recombination/index.html>`_.
